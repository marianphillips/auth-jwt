## Question

What is Base64 and why is it used to construct a JWT?

## Answer

What: A way to encode data so it can be sent as a string

Why: This is usually used when you have a set of data that you want to pass through some channel that might misinterpret some of the characters, but would not misinterpret Base64 characters, so you encode it using Base64 so that the data wonâ€™t get misinterpreted.
